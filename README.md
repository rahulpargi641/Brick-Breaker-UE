# BrickBreaker [Blueprint]

Overview:

This is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and uses it to bounce a ball up to break the bricks above. The player must keep the ball in play and avoid letting it fall off the bottom of the screen.

Implementation:

1. Created a paddle controlled by the player for bouncing the ball.

2. Create bricks of varying types and difficulty levels.

3. Implemented ball movement and collision detection with the paddle and bricks
